README REQS: 
a. Your team members' names, class, an explanation of how to run your program,
a brief description of the pieces of your assignment, any notes from group
discussions, and the workload distribution among the team (who did what).
b. Test cases that you used to test your program. For each of the test cases,
provide:
i. A description of what is being tested
ii. The input
iii. The expected output
iv. The actual output
c. Any known problems of your program, which will help you earn partial
credits.

# Project2
Andre Vincent, Modona Conteh
CSCI201-01 | Dr. Gedare Bloom

This is the composition of the assignment:
Reading in 5 user-inputted integers
Checking to make sure the integers provided are in the range of (0, 32768)
If any integer is not within range, prompt user to enter five integers once more.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Remaining project items:
(7) Return from main using jr $ra (not using the exit syscall). The jr should not cause
an error, and if it does then your program is not using the stack properly.
:Part 2 (15 points)
Test cases to validate the program in Part 1. Be sure to test for correct inputs, corner
cases, and invalid inputs. You will document your test cases in your README file.
In your README file, identify the range, i.e., [min, max], of X, and which test cases hit the
edges of the range.
Requirements
1. Your program must run without error in QtSPIM.
2. COMMENT YOUR CODE. If something doesnâ€™t work, you may get partial credit if
your comments show that you were on the right track.
3. ou must submit a README file.
4. Any repetition must be done using a loop structure. Replication of code for repetition
will not receive credit.
